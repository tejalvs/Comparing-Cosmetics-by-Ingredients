Project Title: Cosmetics Ingredient Comparison for Informed Purchases

Project Description:

Navigating the world of cosmetics can be a daunting task, especially for individuals with sensitive skin. Deciphering complex ingredient lists without a chemistry background can make the process even more challenging. To address this issue, this project employs data science techniques to create a content-based recommendation system based on the chemical components of cosmetics. By processing ingredient lists from 1472 products on Sephora, we aim to empower users to make informed decisions about products that align with their skin type and preferences.

Project Tasks:

Understanding the Complexity:
Recognizing the intricate nature of cosmetics and their chemical compositions.

Focused Exploration:
Narrowing down the analysis to a specific product category and considering the needs of a particular skin type to tailor recommendations effectively.

Ingredient Tokenization:
Employing natural language processing techniques to tokenize and process the ingredient lists for further analysis.

Document-Term Matrix (DTM) Initialization:
Creating a structured DTM to represent the relationships between cosmetics and their chemical components.

Counter Function Creation:
Developing a counter function to quantify the occurrence of each chemical component within the dataset.

Cosmetic-Ingredient Matrix:
Constructing a comprehensive matrix that captures the relationship between cosmetics and their ingredients.

Dimension Reduction with t-SNE:
Utilizing t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for effective dimensionality reduction and visualization of ingredient similarities.

Mapping with Bokeh:
Employing the Bokeh interactive visualization library to create a dynamic and user-friendly map of cosmetic items based on ingredient similarities.

Adding Hover Tool for Insight:
Enhancing the visualization with a hover tool to provide detailed information about specific cosmetic products, aiding users in their decision-making process.

Mapping Cosmetic Items:
Visualizing the cosmetic items on the map, allowing users to explore and compare products effortlessly.

Product Comparison:
Implementing a feature for users to compare two products directly, facilitating a side-by-side analysis of their ingredient compositions.

By combining data science techniques, natural language processing, and interactive visualization, this project aims to demystify cosmetics' ingredient lists, enabling users to make informed and personalized choices tailored to their skin type and preferences.
